Comment 1
I did a good job using event listeners to add interactivity to the skill cards. This keeps the JavaScript simple and easy to understand.

Comment 2
This could be improved by dynamically loading skill data instead of hardcoding it, which would make the app more scalable in future sprints.

Comment 3
This functionality supports Sprint 1 user stories related to browsing and viewing available skills (FR-1) by allowing users to interact with skill listings.
